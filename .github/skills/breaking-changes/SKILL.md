# Breaking Change Audit

Audit pull requests in the `modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk` repository for breaking changes. This skill examines a range of commits, identifies API and behavioral breaking changes, assesses their impact, reconciles `breaking-change` labels, and returns structured results.

## Input

The user provides a commit range in any of these forms:
- `tag..HEAD` (e.g. `v0.8.0-preview.1..HEAD`)
- `tag..tag` (e.g. `v0.8.0-preview.1..v0.9.0-preview.1`)
- `sha..sha`
- `tag..sha` or `sha..HEAD`

If no range is provided, ask the user to specify one.

Use the GitHub API to get the full list of PRs merged within the specified range.

## Process

### Step 1: Examine Every PR

For each PR in the range, study:
- PR description and linked issues
- Full review and comment history
- Complete code diff

Look for both categories of breaking changes:
- **API (compile-time)** — changes to public type signatures, parameter types, return types, removed members, sealed types, new obsoletion attributes, etc.
- **Behavioral (runtime)** — new/changed exceptions, altered return values, changed defaults, modified event ordering, serialization changes, etc.

See [references/classification.md](references/classification.md) for the full classification guide, including SDK-specific versioning policies (experimental APIs, obsoletion lifecycle, and spec-driven changes) that influence how breaks are assessed.

### Step 2: Assess Impact

For each identified breaking change, assess:
- **Breadth** — how many consumers are likely affected (widely-used type vs. obscure API)
- **Severity** — compile-time break (immediate build failure) vs. behavioral (subtle runtime difference)
- **Migration** — straightforward fix vs. significant code changes required

This assessment informs how breaking changes are ordered when presented (most impactful first).

### Step 3: Reconcile Labels

Compare findings against existing `breaking-change` labels on PRs.

Present mismatches to the user interactively:

- **Unlabeled but appears breaking** → explain why the PR appears breaking, ask user to confirm. If confirmed: apply the `breaking-change` label and ask the user whether to comment on the PR explaining the addition.
- **Labeled but does not appear breaking** → explain why, ask user to confirm removal. If confirmed: remove the label and ask the user whether to comment on the PR explaining the removal.

### Step 4: Present Results

Present the final list of confirmed breaking changes, sorted from most impactful to least, with:
- PR number and title
- Classification (API or behavioral)
- Impact assessment summary
- 1-2 bullet description of what breaks and migration guidance

## Output

The audit produces a structured list of breaking changes that can be consumed by other skills (e.g. the **prepare-release** and **publish-release** skills) or presented directly to the user.

Each entry contains:
- PR number and description
- Impact ranking (most → least impactful)
- Detail bullets describing the break and migration path
